excerpt: 'Let $$P(k,n)$$ be the set of products of $k$ factors from the set $$\{1,\ldots , n\}.$$ In 1955, Erd\H{o}s %\cite{erdHos1955some}
posed the problem of determining the order of magnitude of $$|P (2, n)|$$ and
proved that $$|P (2, n)| = o(n^2 )$$ for $$n \to\infty$$.  
In 2015, Darda and Hujdurović %\cite{darda2015bounds} 
asked whether, for each fixed $$n$$, $$|P (k, n)|$$ is a polynomial
in $$k$$ of degree $$\pi(n)$$ - the number of primes not larger than $$n$$.
Recently, Granville, Smith and Walker published an effective version of Khovanskii's Theorem.
We apply this new result to show, that for each integer $$n$$, there is a polynomial $$q_n$$ of degree $$\pi(n)$$ such that $$|P (k, n)|=q_n(k)$$ for each $$k\geq n^2\cdot\left(\prod_{m=1}^{\pi(n)} \log_{p_m}(n)\right)-n+1.$$ Moreover, we give an upper estimate of the leading coefficient of $$q_n$$.'
